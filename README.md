## Computer Science and LASC Capstone Experience
This course fulfills the Capstone Experience requirement for both the Major in Computer Science and the LASC. From the LASC:
>Capstone seminars are offered to students in their junior or senior year through their major field of study for varying credit or through a three-credit course offered within the Liberal Arts and Sciences Curriculum. Capstone seminars completed within a student’s major field of study will count toward major requirements and will meet the LASC capstone experience requirement. 

Capstone seminars:

* provide students the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of a subject area or skill.
* require synthesis and integration of prior knowledge and abilities.
* are designed to facilitate the transition from WSU to the world of work, professional development and/or graduate studies.
* may include research, leadership and internship opportunities, artistic projects, the production of a portfolio of student work, and/or other culminating learning experiences.
