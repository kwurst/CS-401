## Required Materials
In addition to the textbooks, to successfully complete this course you will need:

1.	**Laptop Computer:** You will need a laptop computer that you can bring to class sessions and can use at home. The brand and operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) is unimportant – the software we will be using runs on all major operating systems and can be downloaded for free.  It is expected that you will download and install required software as needed over the course of the semester.
2.	**Internet Access:** You will need Internet access for access to:
    1.	**Github** – We will use Github to host our code.
    2.	**OpenMRS.org** – We will be working on the OpenMRS project, and you will need access to their site and their community tools.
    3.	**WSU Gmail** – You must check your WSU Gmail account on a regular basis. We will be using a class Listserv to communicate, and you will be subscribing to OpenMRS mailing lists.
    4.	**Wordpress or other blogging platform** – You will be keeping a blog about your learning in this course.
    5.	**Tutorials and articles** – I will suggest, and you will research on your own, tutorials and articles for you to learn new technologies and techniques we need.

## Where Does This Course Lead?
* Your professional career

## Course Workload Expectations
***This is a three-credit project-based course. You should expect to spend, on average, 9 hours per week on this class.***
 
You will spend 3 hours per week in class, presenting your team’s work to the class, meeting face-to-face with your team, and possibly learning some new tool or method. In addition, you should expect to spend, on average, at least 6 hours per week during the semester outside of class, writing code and documentation, learning new tools and techniques, and communicating with the team. (See *Definition of the Credit Hour*)

***The bulk of your work in this course will take place outside of the class time. It is not possible to contribute the amount of work your team and the class need to be successful entirely within the 3 hours of class time. If you attempt to do so, you will not only receive a poor grade in the course, but will also be letting down your classmates, and giving a poor impression of your reliability and quality of work to your classmates and to members of the professional community.***

***This is a chance to build your professional reputation – make sure you make a good impression.***

## Definition of the Credit Hour
>Federal regulation defines a credit hour as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutional established equivalence that reasonably approximates not less than –

>1.	One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 
2.	At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

>---New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education, [Policy on Credits and Degrees](http://cihe.neasc.org/downloads/POLICIES/Pp111_PolicyOnCreditsAndDegrees.pdf)

## Attendance
You are expected to attend every class. You will be presenting a group progress report in class each week, meeting with your group to plan the group’s work for the upcoming week, and possibly learning new tools and methods. If there is a reason you must miss class, you should let your group know well in advance. You should still contribute to your group’s presentation, even if you will not be part of giving it. You should also let the instructor know if you must miss a class.

## Prerequisites
This course has a prerequisite of CS 375 – Software Analysis and Design. I expect that you have a reasonable background in software design issues. You will be designing working code and producing design documentation for the project that we are working in over the course of the semester.

CS 375 required CS 242 – Data Structures. I expect that you have a solid background in fundamental data structures, such as lists, queues and trees, know how to use them and how to implement them, and when to select a data structure for a particular problem. I also expect you to be a proficient coder and debugger.

CS 375 required EN 252 – Technical Writing. You should be able to write professionally. You should be able to write professional-quality reports, memos and documentation.

CS 375 required CM 110 – Public Speaking. You should be able to structure and give a professional-quality presentation.

This course has a prerequisite of UR 230 – Technology, Public Policy and Urban Society. I expect that you are able to evaluate the course project for ethical and professional considerations, and write a well-constructed, well-reasoned, and well-supported analysis.

**If you are missing any of this background, you should not take this course.**

## Course Format
This is a course about learning to work within a large, distributed software project. A portion of our class time may be used for me to present some new material on the software development process, tool, group process, or object-oriented design. The bulk of our class time will be used for groups to present designs and code to the class in a peer-review process, and for groups to have a regularly-scheduled meeting time in which to work out process issues and to set goals and tasks for the upcoming week.

## Course Objectives
This course is intended to mimic, as closely as possible, the professional software development team environment. 

You will perform development work in a significant software system, employing knowledge gained from courses taken throughout the Computer Science program. You will work in groups to manage a project; selecting and following appropriate project management techniques. You will work on the requirements, design, implementation, and quality assurance plan, and analyze the project for professional, social, and ethical issues. 

You will learn new technology and techniques on your own as needed for the project. In doing so, you will gain an appreciation for the importance of continuing professional development, and confidence in learning new technology and techniques on your own.

You will reflect on your learning and make frequent written and oral status reports on your individual and team progress. 

You will contribute the results of your work to the professional community, and develop a professional presence and reputation within the community.

## Course-Level Student Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Perform development work on a significant software system, employing knowledge gained from courses throughout the program.
* Work in groups to manage a project, following all appropriate project management techniques.

Each range includes the lower value, but not the upper value. For example, the range of 80 to 83 includes all grades up to, but not including 83. The highest range does, however, include 100%.

## Group Presentations
Your group will give presentations on your progress. The expectations for the progress reports will change as the course progresses. The presentations may include design or code reviews, reports on project organization and structure, or simple status reports. All members of your group are expected to contribute equally to the presentations.

## Blog
You will be required to keep a blog about your part of the project and your experiences in this class. Your blog must be publicly accessible[^1], and will be aggregated on the [CS@Worcester Blog](http://cs.worcester.edu/blog/) and the [Teaching Open Source Planet](http://planet.teachingopensource.org/). 

[^1]: If there is a reason why your name cannot be publicly associated with this course, you may blog under a pseudonym. You must see me to discuss the details, but your blog must still be publicly accessible and aggregated, and you must inform me of your pseudonym.

## Work Products
As you participate in the project, you will be producing various work products – reports, reviews, design documents, code, documentation, etc.

## Final Presentation
Final presentations will be given during our scheduled final exam period – Tuesday, 12 May 2015 from 8:30am-11:30am.

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late assignments will lose 10% of the maximum points per 24-hour period.

***More importantly, your fellow teammates will be relying on you to complete your assigned tasks in a timely fashion, so that they can complete their own. You should be behaving professionally, living up to the group’s expectations and enabling others to do the same.***

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page ([http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/]()) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.

**If you email me, please include “[CS 401]” in the subject line, so that my email program can correctly file your email and ensure that your message does not get buried in my general mailbox.**

**If you email me from an account other than your Worcester State email, please be sure that your name appears somewhere in the email, so that I know who I am communicating with.** 

You may expect that I will get back to you within 24 hours of your email or phone call (with the exception of weekends and holidays), although you will likely hear from me much sooner.

## Code of Conduct/Classroom Civility
All students are expected to adhere to the policies as outlined in the University’s Student Code of Conduct.

## Student Responsibilities 
* Contribute to a class atmosphere conducive to learning for everyone by asking/answering questions, participating in class discussions. Don’t just lurk!
* Seek help when necessary
* Start assignments as soon as they are posted.  Do not wait until the due date to seek help/to do the assignments
* Make use of the academic success center (see below)
* Expect to spend at least 9 hours of work per week on classwork.
* Each student is responsible for the contents of the textbook readings, handouts, and homework assignments.

## Americans with Disabilities Act
Worcester State University and this instructor are committed to the full participation of all students, and will provide accommodations for any student with documented disabilities who are registered with the Disability Services Office (DSO). Please contact the instructor as early as possible to discuss necessary accommodations. All information regarding disabilities will be treated with confidentiality. The DSO is located in the Administration Building, Room 131 and can be reached by phone (508-929-8733) or email (dso@worcester.edu).  

## Tutoring Services/Academic Success Center
Tutoring Services are offered through the Academic Success Center (ASC).  The ASC is located on the first floor of the Administration building, A-130.  Tutoring services are provided to students FREE of charge.  Students seeking academic assistance should visit the center as soon as possible or contact the Tutoring Coordinator at 508-929-8139

## The Writing Center
The writing center provides free assistance to students in the areas of research and writing.  It is located on the third floor of the Sullivan Academic Building, S306.  To schedule an appointment, please call 508-929-8112 or email the Center at writingcenter@worcester.edu.  To find out more information about the Writing Center including the Center’s hours and the Center’s Online Writing Lab, visit their website at [www.worcester.edu/writing]()

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. 

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College’s Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears at: [http://worcester.edu/Academics/Shared%20Documents/AcademicHonesty.aspx]()**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**
